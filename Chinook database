#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with 11 tables in it to quantify statistics about customer-music data
#Analysis

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country <> "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should
show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName,c.LastName,i.invoiceid,i.invoiceDate,i.BillingAddress
FROM chinook.customers as c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices as i
ON c.Customerid=i.customerid
WHERE i.BillingCountry='Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales SupportmAgents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title='Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;
